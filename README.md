[00:12.70] We're dreaming on and on, we're dreaming on and on
[00:18.99] We got the windows down, we got the windows down
[00:42.99] 
[00:25.06] I'm chasing all of the colors in my head, I wanna feel alive
[00:32.18] I'm living high, high, high
[00:37.07] I'm living high
[00:44.57] 
[01:02.42] I'm living high
[01:09.92] 
[01:29.52] We're dreaming on and on, we're dreaming on and on
[01:35.87] The stars are all around, the stars are all around
[02:00.87] 
[01:41.86] I'm chasing all of the colors in my head, I wanna feel alive
[01:48.74] I'm living high, high, high
[01:53.56] I'm living high
[02:01.06] 
[02:19.52] I'm living high
[02:27.02] 
[02:46.56] I got this fire in my heart and I'm feeling alright
[02:52.98] I got this feeling in my head that we're doing alright
[02:59.86] Breaking down the walls, I'm living high
[03:06.85] Chasing all the colors
